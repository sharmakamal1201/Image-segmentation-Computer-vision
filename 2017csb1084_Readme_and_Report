1. Unzib 2017csb1084lab1 folder and extract all files.
2. Open required software (e.g. Anaconda jupyter notebook) and run 2017csb1084_lab1_sol.py
3. Then go to the output folder which contains all 4 segments for each of the 3 different images
4. Console will show the final images stored in 3*4 matrix.


Discussion/Report:


Final results:
1. Water coins
			Images are segmented i.e. coins and water are separated with different color.
			Best result came with 3 segments.
			Coins are properly separated from water .(coins are in Reddish brown color while water is light green).

2. Jump
			Images are segmented i.e. man, snow and rest background are separated with different color.
			Best result came with 5 segments.
			Man is properly separated from snow and background .(snow is in light green color while dark background is in reddish brown color and light background is light blue).

3. Tiger
			Images are segmented i.e. tiger and grass/land are separated with different color.
			Best result came with 5 segments.
			Tiger is properly separated from grass and land .(tiger is in red & blue color while land is in reddish color and grass is in green & blue color, some part of river is shown in black).


I have learnt how EM iteration algorithm work and how KMeans algorithm cluster.
AS iteration no. increases mean and sigma of different colors starts converging to the actual means and sigmas.
If the initial guess is nearer to mu and sigma results are better.
In this case we have taken mu as (1/nsegments).
We added a noise initially to see the results.
Finally all 12 convergence/last_iteration_image is stored in 3*4 matrix to displat the final result.
At max 20 EM iterations are taken.
Some of the images converges before all iteration completely because of less mean and deviation difference.
